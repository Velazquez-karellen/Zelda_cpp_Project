# ZeldaCPP
The Legend of Zelda: CPP Edition

## Project Overview
This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course **CIIC4010/ICOM4015**. 
The base code, along with initial implementations, was developed by **Jomard Concepcion** and **Jann Garcia**, 
with contributions from the class instructors. We gratefully acknowledge their work as the foundation for this project.

## Team Contributions
The project was further developed by **Karellen A. Velazquez Rivera** and **Alianis Vallejos Nazario** as part of the course requirements. Together, we implemented and refined the following features:
- Added a new enemy: "Bob," who brings a unique challenge to the game. (See `Enemy.cpp` for logic and `entitySprites.png` for sprites.)
- Enhanced item interactions, including the sword item mechanic in the Old Manâ€™s Cave (`Recursive.h`, `MapBuilder`).
- Created a dungeon with recursive tiles, improving player immersion and gameplay depth.

For further details about the features we developed, see the **Student Notes** section below.

## My Additions/Second phase
I will be expanding the game beyond the scope of the class requirements. This phase includes:
1. Adding new enemies with varied behaviors and interactions.
2. Designing additional dungeons with puzzles and bosses to enrich the game narrative.
3. **Expanding the map** to include new areas and environments for players to explore.
4. Improving visuals and animations for a smoother and more engaging player experience.

The updated features and mechanics will be added in the **second phase** of this project. Stay tuned for updates!

## Setup
1. Clone this project inside an OpenFrameworks installation's `apps/myApps/` directory.
2. Build and run the project.

## Acknowledgments
